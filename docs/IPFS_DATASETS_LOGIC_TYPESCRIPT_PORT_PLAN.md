# IPFS Datasets Logic TypeScript Port Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This project already contains the Portland City Code corpus, generated search assets, knowledge graph artifacts, and machine-generated logic proof summaries. The improvement track is to port the full `ipfs_datasets_py/ipfs_datasets_py/logic` module into a browser-native TypeScript/WASM logic stack. Heavyweight theorem provers, NLP dependencies, ML confidence scoring, cryptographic proof systems, and chain integrations should be replaced with TypeScript or WebAssembly implementations rather than external server-side calls.

The practical goal is to translate the entire Python logic surface area into TypeScript/WASM in phases. The runtime target is browser-native TypeScript/WebAssembly only. The app must not depend on external server-side services for logic conversion, ML/NLP confidence, proving, or verification.

Update: Python ML confidence scoring and spaCy-style NLP extraction are required porting targets. They must be ported to browser-native equivalents using TypeScript, WebAssembly, Transformers.js, ONNX/WebGPU, or other local browser-compatible packages. Python can only serve as the source implementation and fixture generator during development.

## Current Project Fit

The repository is a Vite/React/TypeScript static app with existing Portland corpus support:

- `src/lib/portlandCorpus.ts` loads sections, BM25 documents, embeddings, entities, relationships, and graph adjacency from `public/corpus/portland-or/current/generated/`.
- `public/corpus/portland-or/current/generated/logic-proof-summaries.json` already exposes per-section formalization data, including `deontic_temporal_fol`, `deontic_cognitive_event_calculus`, `frame_logic_ergo`, `norm_operator`, `norm_type`, `zkp_backend`, `zkp_security_note`, and `zkp_verified`.
- `package.json` already includes browser-oriented foundations that help this port: TypeScript, Jest, Playwright, DuckDB-WASM, parquet-wasm, Transformers.js, hnswlib-wasm, and Vite workers.
- `docs/PORTLAND_LEGAL_CORPUS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` already identifies proof artifact exploration and browser theorem-prover research as future phases.

The Python source tree has a broad logic surface:

- Foundation: `logic/types`, `logic/common`, `logic/config.py`, `logic/batch_processing.py`.
- FOL: `logic/fol`, including text-to-FOL conversion, parser utilities, predicate extraction, and output formatters.
- Deontic: `logic/deontic`, including legal-text-to-deontic conversion and normative conflict helpers.
- TDFOL: `logic/TDFOL`, including AST types, parser, converter, prover, inference rules, proof cache, proof visualization, security validator, and performance tooling.
- CEC/DCEC: `logic/CEC`, including event calculus, modal/cognitive inference, native prover machinery, NL policy compilers, and bridges.
- F-logic: `logic/flogic`, including frame/class/query/ontology types and ErgoAI rendering.
- Integration: `logic/integration`, `logic/integrations`, `search/logic_integration`, and GraphRAG-specific bridge code.
- ZKP: `logic/zkp`, including deterministic canonicalization, statement/witness structures, verifier/prover abstractions, Groth16/FFI backends, EVM integration, and simulated backends.
- External provers: `logic/external_provers`, including Z3, CVC5, E Prover, Vampire, Lean, Coq, and routing.
- Operational modules: API server, CLI, security, observability, monitoring, dashboards, benchmarks.

## Full Python Module Coverage Inventory

The full-port target is the entire `ipfs_datasets_py/ipfs_datasets_py/logic` tree, currently 304 Python files. The TypeScript/WASM work should track every area below until it has browser-native parity, a browser-native replacement, or a documented blocking issue.

| `logic/observability` | 4 | In-browser metrics, traces, diagnostics, and developer panels. |
| Top-level modules | 11 | `api.py`, `api_server.py`, `cli.py`, `batch_processing.py`, `benchmarks.py`, `monitoring.py`, `ml_confidence.py`, `config.py`, validation scripts, and package entry points reworked as TS APIs, local dev scripts, or browser tools. |

## Guiding Principle

Port behavior first, but account for every file.

The TypeScript target should be a clean client-side domain library that preserves the Python module's semantics without blindly copying Python layout. Browser code should be deterministic, inspectable, offline-capable, and tested against Python parity fixtures. Anything that depends on subprocesses, Python ML packages, prover binaries, secrets, chain RPC, or native dependencies must receive a TypeScript/WASM replacement. Temporary capability reporting is allowed only while a module is mid-port, not as the final state.

## Target Outcomes

1. Add first-class TypeScript types for Portland logic artifacts.
2. Load and index proof summaries alongside existing corpus data.
3. Parse the generated TDFOL, DCEC, and F-logic strings into lightweight ASTs or structured views.
4. Validate formulas and proof metadata deterministically in the browser.
5. Add norm-aware filters and ranking signals to search.
6. Add a proof explorer UI that explains obligations, permissions, prohibitions, temporal operators, supporting code sections, and generated certificate metadata.
7. Add client-side reasoning that grows from bounded forward chaining into full TDFOL/CEC/DCEC parity.
8. Replace Python as the authoritative formalization generator once TypeScript/WASM parity is proven.
9. Port Python ML confidence scoring and spaCy NLP extraction to browser-native ML/NLP.
10. Port external prover bridges and ZKP backends to browser-native WASM or equivalent local packages.

## Proposed TypeScript Architecture

Add a new `src/lib/logic/` package:

```text
src/lib/logic/
  index.ts
  types.ts
  errors.ts
  cache.ts
  proofArtifacts.ts
  tdfol/
    ast.ts
    lexer.ts
    parser.ts
    formatter.ts
    validate.ts
    converter.ts
    reasoner.ts
  fol/
    parser.ts
    predicateExtractor.ts
    formatter.ts
    converter.ts
  deontic/
    types.ts
    parser.ts
    converter.ts
    conflicts.ts
  flogic/
    types.ts
    parser.ts
    formatter.ts
  zkp/
    canonicalization.ts
    statement.ts
    simulatedVerifier.ts
  graph/
    proofGraph.ts
    normIndex.ts
```

The public API should stay small:

```ts
loadLogicProofSummaries(): Promise<LogicProofSummary[]>
getLogicProofForSection(ipfsCid: string): Promise<LogicProofSummary | null>
parseTdfolFormula(source: string): TdfolFormula
validateLogicProofSummary(summary: LogicProofSummary): LogicValidationResult
buildNormIndex(summaries: LogicProofSummary[]): NormIndex
searchByNorm(query: NormQuery): LogicProofSummary[]
explainNorm(summary: LogicProofSummary): LogicExplanation
verifySimulatedCertificate(summary: LogicProofSummary): SimulatedVerificationResult
```

## Data Model Improvements

Add TypeScript contracts for the existing generated artifact:

```ts
export type NormOperator = 'O' | 'P' | 'F' | 'unknown';
export type NormType = 'obligation' | 'permission' | 'prohibition' | 'unknown';
export type FormalizationStatus = 'success' | 'partial' | 'failed' | 'unknown';

export interface LogicProofSummary {
  ipfs_cid: string;
  identifier: string;
  title: string;
  formalization_scope: string;
  fol_status: FormalizationStatus;
  deontic_status: FormalizationStatus;
  deontic_temporal_fol: string;
  deontic_cognitive_event_calculus: string;
  frame_logic_ergo: string;
  norm_operator: NormOperator;
  norm_type: NormType;
  zkp_backend: 'simulated' | 'groth16' | 'unknown';
  zkp_security_note: string;
  zkp_verified: boolean;
}
```

Derived indexes:

- `proofByCid`: map section CID to proof summary.
- `proofByIdentifier`: map Portland citation to proof summary.
- `normByOperator`: `O`, `P`, `F`.
- `formalizationStatusCounts`: success/partial/failed/unknown counts.
- `proofParseStatus`: TDFOL/DCEC/F-logic parse success by section.
- `sectionLogicSignals`: search ranking signals derived from norm type, status, and operator.

## Integration With Existing Corpus Service

Extend `src/lib/portlandCorpus.ts` or add a sibling `src/lib/portlandLogic.ts`.

Recommended split:

- Keep `portlandCorpus.ts` focused on sections, BM25, embeddings, and KG.
- Add `portlandLogic.ts` for proof summaries, norm indexes, and parsed formula caches.
- Add shared ID helpers for `ipfs_cid`, `identifier`, and Portland citation normalization.

New corpus-level APIs:

```ts
getSectionWithLogic(ipfsCid: string): Promise<{
  section: CorpusSection | null;
  proof: LogicProofSummary | null;
  relatedGraph: { entities: CorpusEntity[]; relationships: CorpusRelationship[] };
}>

searchCorpusWithLogic(
  query: string,
  filters: SearchFilters & LogicSearchFilters,
  mode: SearchMode,
  queryEmbedding?: Float32Array | number[],
): Promise<SearchResult[]>
```

Logic-aware search filters:

```ts
export interface LogicSearchFilters {
  normOperators?: NormOperator[];
  normTypes?: NormType[];
  formalizationStatuses?: FormalizationStatus[];
  requireVerifiedCertificate?: boolean;
  requireParseableTdfol?: boolean;
}
```

## UI Improvements Enabled By The Port

1. Proof artifact explorer
   - Section-level panel showing TDFOL, DCEC, F-logic, norm type, operator, status, and certificate note.
   - Parse status badges with precise errors.
   - Toggle between raw source, formatted AST, and plain-English explanation.

2. Norm-aware search
   - Filters for obligations, permissions, prohibitions, formalization status, and certificate metadata.
   - Search result badges for norm type and proof status.
   - Ranking boost when query terms match norm semantics such as "must", "may", "prohibited", "deadline", or "penalty".

3. Logic graph view
   - Start with the existing KG adjacency.
   - Add proof-derived nodes: section, norm, actor, action, condition, temporal operator, certificate.
   - Keep this bounded and inspectable for the first implementation slice.

4. Explanation layer
   - Translate `O`, `P`, `F`, `always`, `eventually`, `SubjectTo`, and `ComplyWith` into short user-facing labels.
   - Always label generated formalizations as machine-generated candidates.
   - Always distinguish simulated educational certificates from cryptographic proof verification.

5. GraphRAG improvements
   - Add logic facts to the evidence pack.
   - Prefer citations with successful formalizations when the user asks normative questions.
   - Let the answer cite both code text and logic metadata, with clear caveats.

- [x] Decide which parity path to use: browser-native replacement or WASM only for runtime; Python fixtures are development-only.

Acceptance criteria:

- The TypeScript converter can classify simple Portland-style legal clauses as obligation, permission, or prohibition.
- It can explain why an operator was selected using matched phrases.
- It never overwrites the authoritative generated artifact without explicit user action.
- It documents where browser heuristics differ from Python ML/spaCy outputs.

- Temporary incomplete-port behavior is explicit in API results and UI copy until browser-native parity lands.
- The TypeScript implementation can run without Python; Python-enhanced outputs may be compared only in development or CI fixture-generation workflows.

- [x] Port `evm_public_inputs.py` browser-native BN254 field packing helpers for EVM public inputs without chain calls.
- [x] Port `vk_registry.py` and initial `eth_vk_registry_payloads.py` browser-native VK hashing, registry, bytes32 normalization, and registerVK payload validation without RPC calls.
- [x] Port `eth_contract_artifacts.py` as browser-native contract artifact object/JSON parsing for ABI and bytecode without filesystem path loading.
- [x] Add `verifySimulatedCertificate()` that checks metadata consistency only.
- [x] Rename UI language so `zkp_verified: true` with `zkp_backend: simulated` is shown as "simulated certificate present", not "cryptographically verified".

- Every inferred hint includes source sections and rule names.

## Full-Port Completion Definition

The port is complete only when every Python logic capability has one of these browser-native outcomes:

- TypeScript implementation with parity tests.
- WebAssembly/browser-library implementation with parity tests.
- Tracked incomplete capability with a blocking issue, temporary capability flag, and no silent fallback.

Python may remain as a fixture generator and source reference, but not as a production runtime dependency.

## TypeScript Port Estimate

Current completed TypeScript/WASM port slice:

- 100 percent of shared types needed by the UI.
- 75-85 percent of common module behavior: cache, converter lifecycle, browser feature detection, proof cache, utility monitoring, validation, and error surfaces.
- 100 percent of proof summary loading, indexing, validation, and display helpers.
- 80-90 percent of TDFOL core AST/parser/formatter behavior needed for generated Portland formulas.
- 70-80 percent of TDFOL inference/prover/explanation/operations behavior: initial converter outputs, propositional, first-order, temporal, deontic rules, tableaux expansion rules, bounded forward/backward/bidirectional chaining, local CEC delegation, modal tableaux, strategy selection, indexed-KB optimization, countermodels, proof explanations, dependency graphs, proof tree views, security validation, metrics collection, profiling, dashboarding, and performance-engine orchestration.
- 75-85 percent of regex FOL/deontic extraction, formatter, analyzer, and knowledge-base behavior, focused on legal-code clauses.
- 70-80 percent of F-logic data modeling and display rendering for generated frame snippets.
- 50-60 percent of ZKP canonicalization/statement metadata behavior.
- 10-20 percent of prover behavior, currently limited to bounded local reasoning and explanation traces.

Remaining full-port work:

- Full CEC native prover parity.
- Full TDFOL prover parity across all inference rules.
- External prover bridge parity through browser-native WASM/local packages.
- Cryptographic proof generation and verification through browser-native libraries.
- Python NLP/ML parity through browser-native NLP/ML implementations.

## Testing Strategy

Unit tests:

- Proof summary schema guards and indexes.
- TDFOL tokenization, parsing, formatting, substitution, and free-variable analysis.
- FOL quantifier/operator parsing and predicate normalization.
- Deontic phrase extraction and norm classification.
- F-logic frame parsing/rendering.
- ZKP canonicalization and simulated verification wording.
- Cache TTL/LRU behavior.

Integration tests:

- Load corpus plus logic proofs and join by CID.
- Search with norm filters.
- Build a GraphRAG evidence pack with logic metadata.
- Validate generated proof summaries and report parse failures.

Playwright tests:

- Proof panel renders on desktop and mobile.
- Search filters do not overlap or resize unexpectedly.
- Raw and structured logic views remain readable for long formulas.
- Simulated certificate copy is visible where relevant.

Parity tests:

- Fixed fixtures from `ipfs_datasets_py` outputs.
- Generated Portland proof summary samples.
- Round-trip normalized formulas.
- Known failures documented instead of ignored.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Porting the entire Python module creates a large browser bundle. | Preserve the full parity target, but split implementations with dynamic imports, optional local model artifacts, and WASM chunks. |
| Formalization output may be machine-generated and imperfect. | Label all logic artifacts as candidate formalizations and keep original legal text primary. |
| Simulated ZKP metadata may be mistaken for real crypto verification. | Use explicit UI copy and API names such as `verifySimulatedCertificate`. |
| Parser parity may drift from Python. | Add fixture-based parity tests and document intentional differences. |
| TDFOL syntax includes Unicode operators. | Support both symbolic and ASCII aliases; normalize internally. |
| External prover expectations may creep into client code. | Define a `ProverBackend` interface and route only to browser-native TypeScript/WASM adapters. |
| Licensing may affect reuse. | Review `ipfs_datasets_py/LICENSE` and this repo's `LICENSE` before copying substantive code. Prefer clean-room TypeScript where needed. |

## Documentation Deliverables

- `docs/IPFS_DATASETS_LOGIC_TYPESCRIPT_PORT_PLAN.md`: this plan.
- `docs/LOGIC_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA.md`: generated proof summary schema and examples.
- `docs/LOGIC_PORT_PARITY.md`: Python-to-TypeScript parity matrix and divergences.
- `docs/LOGIC_REASONING_LIMITATIONS.md`: user-facing limitations, safety notes, and certificate wording.
- `docs/LOGIC_WASM_RESEARCH.md`: decision record for any prover or crypto WASM dependency.

## Recommended First Pull Request

The first implementation PR should be intentionally small:

1. Add `src/lib/portlandLogic.ts`.
2. Add TypeScript proof summary types and lazy loader.
3. Add indexes by CID, identifier, norm operator, and norm type.
4. Add validation with warnings for simulated certificates.
5. Add Jest tests using a tiny fixture.
6. Add a minimal proof metadata panel to the existing Portland section detail UI, if that UI is already ready.

That PR gives the project immediate product value without committing to a full theorem prover port.

### Latest Round

- Target: `Task checkbox-230: Port remaining Python logic module 'logic/CEC/native/prover_core.py' to browser-native TypeScript/WASM, including focused validation tests and no server or Python runtime dependency.`
- Result: `needs follow-up`
- Summary: Ported a browser-native CEC prover_core parity slice for premise-array proving, validity metadata, cloned traces, rule usage, timing, and local statistics.
- Impact: src/lib/logic/cec/prover.ts exposes Python prover_core-style local proof helpers and deterministic result metadata without server, Python, filesystem, subprocess, RPC, or Node-only browser runtime dependencies. src/lib/logic/cec/prover.test.ts validates the premise-array contract, statistics, rule usage, result validity, and trace cloning through Jest. docs/IPFS_DATASETS_LOGIC_TYPESCRIPT_PORT_PLAN.md marks checkbox-230 complete in the task ledger.
- Accepted changed files: `docs/IPFS_DATASETS_LOGIC_TYPESCRIPT_PORT_PLAN.md`, `src/lib/logic/cec/prover.test.ts`, `src/lib/logic/cec/prover.ts`
- Errors: Rejected proposal because TypeScript replacement preflight found parser or generic/type-quality errors before touching the worktree:

### Required Daemon Behavior

- Work only on the current port-plan target unless the task is already complete in code and tests.
- For implementation tasks, accepted work must change runtime TypeScript under `src/lib/logic/`; fixture-only work is reserved for fixture/capture/documentation tasks.
- If a round fails, keep the task marked as needing follow-up and use the validation error as the next-cycle constraint.
- Mark a task complete only after TypeScript validation and logic-port tests pass for the accepted change.
- Keep browser runtime changes TypeScript/WASM-native with no server or Python service dependency.
