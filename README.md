# Portland City Code Legal Research

[Live Site](https://portland-laws.github.io)

A static, browser-only research tool for exploring and querying the **Portland, Oregon City Code**. All computation runs directly in your browser — no backend server, no API keys, no accounts required.

## What This Is

This repository is a static Vite/React/TypeScript application that provides:

- **Corpus Browser**: Browse all 3,052 sections of the Portland City Code organized by Title and Chapter
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine keyword (BM25), vector similarity, and knowledge-graph-expanded search in one query
- **GraphRAG Chat**: Ask plain-language questions and receive citation-grounded answers generated entirely in-browser
- **Knowledge Graph Explorer**: Visualize entities and relationships extracted from the legal corpus
- **Logic Proof Explorer**: Inspect formal logic artifacts (obligations, permissions, prohibitions, temporal operators, ZKP certificates) derived from each section
- **Browser Logic Engine**: A growing TypeScript/WASM port of the Python `ipfs_datasets_py` logic module, enabling deterministic browser-native theorem proving, TDFOL/CEC/DCEC parsing, deontic analysis, F-logic rendering, and ZKP metadata verification

## Corpus

The corpus is sourced from the Hugging Face dataset [`justicedao/american_municipal_law`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/justicedao/american_municipal_law), specifically the Portland, OR current-code artifacts:

- **3,052 canonical sections** with full text, Bluebook citations, source URLs, and JSON-LD metadata
- **BM25 precomputed term frequencies** for fast keyword search
- **384-dimensional `thenlper/gte-small` embeddings** for semantic vector search
- **Knowledge graph entities and relationships** extracted from the corpus
- **Logic proof artifacts** — per-section TDFOL, DCEC, F-logic formalizations, norm metadata, and ZKP certificate summaries

All corpus assets are pre-generated at build time and served as static files under `public/corpus/portland-or/current/generated/`. The app never calls the Hugging Face Dataset Viewer API at runtime.

## Browser Logic Engine

The logic layer (`src/lib/logic/`) is a browser-native TypeScript port of the `ipfs_datasets_py/ipfs_datasets_py/logic` Python module. It is designed to be deterministic, offline-capable, and free of any server-side dependencies.

### Currently Ported

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `logic/types` | Discriminated union types and interfaces mirroring Python dataclasses and enums |
| `logic/common` | Converter lifecycle, bounded cache, proof cache, validation, feature detection, and utility monitor |
| `logic/fol` | FOL regex quantifier/operator parsing, predicate extraction, logical relation extraction, variable allocation, and output formatters |
| `logic/deontic` | Deontic operator classification, formula construction, analyzer, knowledge-base primitives, norm extraction, conflict detection, and compliance checks |
| `logic/tdfol` | TDFOL AST, parser, formatter, inference rules (Modus Ponens/Tollens, temporal K/T, deontic K/D, etc.), forward-chaining prover, proving strategies, modal tableaux, countermodels, proof explainer, dependency graph, proof tree visualizer, security validator, and performance dashboard/profiler/metrics |
| `logic/cec` | CEC/DCEC AST, parser, formatter, analyzer, DCEC cleaning and preprocessing helpers, DCEC parse-token/prefixing helpers, syntax tree utilities, grammar loader/engine, ShadowProver problem parser (TPTP `fof`/`cnf`), native inference rules (propositional/first-order/modal/temporal/deontic/cognitive/resolution/specialized), fluent/event state manager, discrete event calculus (`Happens`/`Initiates`/`Terminates`/`HoldsAt`/`Clipped`), context manager, ambiguity resolver, ShadowProver facade, bounded prover, proof cache, proof explainer, dependency graph and tree visualizer, modal tableaux, countermodels, performance dashboard/profiler/metrics, and security validator |
| `logic/flogic` | F-logic frame, class, ontology, query, semantic normalization, and ErgoAI rendering |
| `logic/zkp` | Deterministic canonicalization and simulated ZKP certificate metadata checks |

### Roadmap

- **Phase 11**: Full TDFOL prover/inference-rule parity and richer interactive visualizations
- **Phase 12**: Full CEC/DCEC advanced strategies and complete prover parity
- **Phase 13**: Browser-native ML/NLP parity for FOL/deontic confidence scoring and spaCy-style NLP extraction using Transformers.js / ONNX / WebGPU
- **Phase 14**: ZKP Groth16/EVM/browser-native crypto parity
- **Phase 15**: IPFS-backed proof cache semantics

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/portland-laws/portland-laws.github.io.git
cd portland-laws.github.io
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 to explore the app locally.

> **Note**: The corpus assets in `public/corpus/portland-or/current/generated/` are committed to the repository and are ready to use immediately. You do not need to re-run the data pipeline to start developing.

## Corpus Build Pipeline

If you need to regenerate the static corpus assets from the upstream Hugging Face dataset:

```sh
# 1. Download and process the Portland corpus parquet artifacts
python3 scripts/extract-portland-corpus.py

# 2. Generate optimized static assets (section-index, embeddings.f32, BM25 docs, KG adjacency, etc.)
npm run prepare:portland-corpus

# 3. Validate the generated assets
npm run validate:portland-corpus
```

Generated assets are written to `public/corpus/portland-or/current/generated/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `sections.json` | Full canonical section rows |
| `section-index.json` | Lightweight index of identifiers, titles, and chapter/title metadata |
| `bm25-documents.json` | Tokenized term-frequency documents for BM25 keyword search |
| `embeddings.f32` | Packed `Float32Array` of 384-dimensional `gte-small` embeddings |
| `embedding-index.json` | `ipfs_cid` lookup map for the embedding array |
| `entities.json` | Knowledge graph entity records |
| `relationships.json` | Knowledge graph relationship records |
| `graph-adjacency.json` | Precomputed KG adjacency maps for fast one-hop/two-hop expansion |
| `logic-proof-summaries.json` | Per-section TDFOL, DCEC, F-logic formalizations, norm metadata, and ZKP certificate summaries |
| `generated-manifest.json` | Row counts, embedding dimensions, and content hashes for validation |

## Testing

```sh
# Unit and integration tests (Jest)
npm test

# Logic port parity tests against Python-generated fixtures
npm run validate:logic-port

# End-to-end tests (Playwright)
npm run test:playwright
```

## Deployment

Every push to `main` automatically builds and deploys the app to GitHub Pages via the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The live site is at **https://portland-laws.github.io**.

You can also trigger a deployment manually from the GitHub Actions tab.
